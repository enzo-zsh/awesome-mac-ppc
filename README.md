## Web Browser

### RetroZilla web browser :

**Store :**  Macintosh Garden

**Description :** RetroZilla v2.2 is one of the only open source web browsers that connect to modern HTTPS websites in vanilla Windows 98. I modified the source enough to make it work on OS X, so it is now also available for legacy PowerPC Mac OS X. It unfortunately does not run on 10.2 or 10.3 (yet). 10.4/10.5 are fine.

### Sorbet Leopard :

**Store :**  Macintosh Garden

**Description :** Imagine if Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released for the PowerPC architecture. Aging machines would have received a much-needed boost in performance, software updates would have carried on for a little bit further, and instrumental features would have been newly claimed -- resulting in pre-existing hardware being kept in service for much longer.
